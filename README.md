Mini challenge #3 "Asking Questions"
This is a console project that will ask our user their name and what time they woke up.

Review: Freddy Aguilar
The program asks the user two questions and prompts them to input an answer for each. It then prints out the users inputs into a sentence. The program works as intended and allows it to be replayed towards the end. Data validation is set for the first input to ensure numbers arent put in place of the sring it asks for. Though te second input allows me to type in a string when it is asking for time one woke up. Other than this program works well! I like the way the code is wrtten since it is organized and easy to read! Good job!
